Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away
And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and fall there with a sigh
O troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints in my words
The world puts off its mask of vastness to its lover It becomes small as one song, as one kiss of the eternal
It is the tears of the earth that keep her smiles in bloom
The mighty desert is burning for the love of a blade of grass who shakes her head and laughs and flies away
If you shed tears when you miss the sun, you also miss the stars
The sands in your way beg for your song and your movement, dancing water Will you carry the burden of their lameness
Her wistful face haunts my dreams like the rain at night
Once we dreamt that we were strangers We wake up to find that we were dear to each other
Sorrow is hushed into peace in my heart like the evening among the silent trees
Some unseen fingers, like idle breeze, are playing upon my heart the music of the ripples
What language is thine, O sea
The language of eternal question
What language is thy answer, O sky
The language of eternal silence
Listen, my heart, to the whispers of the world with which it makes love to you
The mystery of creation is like the darkness of night--it is great Delusions of knowledge are like the fog of the morning
Do not seat your love upon a precipice because it is high
I sit at my window this morning where the world like a passer-by stops for a moment, nods to me and goes
These little thoughts are the rustle of leaves; they have their whisper of joy in my mind
What you are you do not see, what you see is your shadow
My wishes are fools, they shout across thy songs, my Master Let me but listen
I cannot choose the best The best chooses me
They throw their shadows before them who carry their lantern on their back
That I exist is a perpetual surprise which is life
We, the rustling leaves, have a voice that answers the storms, but who are you so silent
I am a mere flower
Rest belongs to the work as the eyelids to the eyes
Man is a born child, his power is the power of growth
God expects answers for the flowers he sends us, not for the sun and the earth
The light that plays, like a naked child, among the green leaves happily knows not that man can lie
O Beauty, find thyself in love, not in the flattery of thy mirror
My heart beats her waves at the shore of the world and writes upon it her signature in tears with the words, I love thee
Moon, for what do you wait
To salute the sun for whom I must make way
The trees come up to my window like the yearning voice of the dumb earth
His own mornings are new surprises to God
Life finds its wealth by the claims of the world, and its worth by the claims of love
The dry river-bed finds no thanks for its past
The bird wishes it were a cloud The cloud wishes it were a bird
The waterfall sings, I find my song, when I find my freedom
I cannot tell why this heart languishes in silence It is for small needs it never asks, or knows or remembers
Woman, when you move about in your household service your limbs sing like a hill stream among its pebbles
The sun goes to cross the Western sea, leaving its last salutation to the East
Do not blame your food because you have no appetite
The trees, like the longings of the earth, stand a-tiptoe to peep at the heaven
You smiled and talked to me of nothing and I felt that for this I had been waiting long
The fish in the water is silent, the animal on the earth is noisy, the bird in the air is singing,
But Man has in him the silence of the sea, the noise of the earth and the music of the air
The world rushes on over the strings of the lingering heart making the music of sadness
He has made his weapons his gods When his weapons win he is defeated himself
God finds himself by creating
Shadow, with her veil drawn, follows Light in secret meekness, with her silent steps of love
The stars are not afraid to appear like fireflies
I thank thee that I am none of the wheels of power but I am one with the living creatures that are crushed by it
The mind, sharp but not broad, sticks at every point but does not move
Your idol is shattered in the dust to prove that God's dust is greater than your idol
Man does not reveal himself in his history, he struggles up through it
While the glass lamp rebukes the earthen for calling it cousin, the moon rises, and the glass lamp, with a bland smile, calls her, My dear, dear sister
Like the meeting of the seagulls and the waves we meet and come near The seagulls fly off, the waves roll away and we depart
My day is done, and I am like a boat drawn on the beach, listening to the dance-music of the tide in the evening
Life is given to us, we earn it by giving it
We come nearest to the great when we are great in humility
The sparrow is sorry for the peacock at the burden of its tail
Never be afraid of the moments--thus sings the voice of the everlasting
The hurricane seeks the shortest road by the no-road, and suddenly ends its search in the Nowhere
Take my wine in my own cup, friend It loses its wreath of foam when poured into that of others
The Perfect decks itself in beauty for the love of the Imperfect
God says to man, I heal you therefore I hurt, love you therefore punish
Thank the flame for its light, but do not forget the lampholder standing in the shade with constancy of patience
Tiny grass, your steps are small, but you possess the earth under your tread
The infant flower opens its bud and cries, Dear World, please do not fade
God grows weary of great kingdoms, but never of little flowers
Wrong cannot afford defeat but Right can
I give my whole water in joy, sings the waterfall, though little of it is enough for the thirsty
Where is the fountain that throws up these flowers in a ceaseless outbreak of ecstasy
The woodcutter's axe begged for its handle from the tree The tree gave it
In my solitude of heart I feel the sigh of this widowed evening veiled with mist and rain
Chastity is a wealth that comes from abundance of love
The mist, like love, plays upon the heart of the hills and brings out surprises of beauty
We read the world wrong and say that it deceives us
The poet wind is out over the sea and the forest to seek his own voice
Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man
The grass seeks her crowd in the earth The tree seeks his solitude of the sky
Man barricades against himself
Your voice, my friend, wanders in my heart, like the muffled sound of the sea among these listening pines
What is this unseen flame of darkness whose sparks are the stars
Let life be beautiful like summer flowers and death like autumn leaves
He who wants to do good knocks at the gate; he who loves finds the gate open
In death the many becomes one; in life the one becomes many
Religion will be one when God is dead
The artist is the lover of Nature, therefore he is her slave and her master
How far are you from me, O Fruit
I am hidden in your heart, O Flower
This longing is for the one who is felt in the dark, but not seen in the day
You are the big drop of dew under the lotus leaf, I am the smaller one on its upper side, said the dewdrop to the lake
The scabbard is content to be dull when it protects the keenness of the sword
In darkness the One appears as uniform; in the light the One appears as manifold
The great earth makes herself hospitable with the help of the grass
The birth and death of the leaves are the rapid whirls of the eddy whose wider circles move slowly among stars
Power said to the world, You are mine
The world kept it prisoner on her throne
Love said to the world, I am thine
The world gave it the freedom of her house
The mist is like the earth's desire It hides the sun for whom she cries
Be still, my heart, these great trees are prayers
The noise of the moment scoffs at the music of the Eternal
I think of other ages that floated upon the stream of life and love and death and are forgotten, and I feel the freedom of passing away
The sadness of my soul is her bride's veil It waits to be lifted in the night
Death's stamp gives value to the coin of life; making it possible to buy with life what is truly precious
The cloud stood humbly in a corner of the sky The morning crowned it with splendour
The dust receives insult and in return offers her flowers
Do not linger to gather flowers to keep them, but walk on, for flowers will keep themselves blooming all your way
Roots are the branches down in the earth Branches are roots in the air
The music of the far-away summer flutters around the Autumn seeking its former nest
Do not insult your friend by lending him merits from your own pocket
